This variant likely refers to the colonial-era shipyards of San Juan, Puerto Rico.  It alternates back and forth between two tones, in which each sawyer asks for something (often nonsensical) that rhymes with his name- Juan with pan, Pedro with queso, Roque with alfandoque, Enrique with alfeñique.  Tickling songs provide a fun, interactive activity for both young children and adults.  The adult is supposed to rock the child back and forth in rhythm with the saw, and then tickle on the final triqui-trán, to make the child laugh."

          "HS - Whaling was a major industry in early America.  Whale oil was in demand and brought high prices.  Sailors signed on whaling vessels for a share of the profit.  The venture was dangerous, and some whaling voyages lasted for several years.  To amuse themselves on these long trips, sailors made up songs about their activities and adventures.  Blow Ye Winds is one of the stories American sailors told in song.  The melody is an old English ballad which originally may have been a dancing song."

          "HNU - Hunting dogs are highly prized by southern country people, and numerous songs express their owners' pride in and friendship for their dogs. This song has been widely collected from both black and white singers but is generally thought to be of black authorship.  The melodies of the collected versions are diverse.  Some versions include syllables imitating a howling hound, but most exhibit a striking stability of text and paint the picture found here: the preliminary boast about a favorite dog, the possum hunt, the dog's sickness, the doctor's verdict, the dog's death, his burial, and a stanza about meeting him in heave.  One variant ends: Blue, Blue, you rascal, you,I wish it was me instead of you. Although the burial with a silver spade and a golden chain is borrowed from English tradition, Blue is an American song through and through. According to the collector’s notes, the Scruggs sisters (fifteen, sixteen, and thirteen years old respectively) sang together often, sometimes with guitar and sometimes with piano accompaniment."

I remember singing it over and over as I walked back some three miles from his home out in the country. The kinship of all folk music was once made clear to me out in Arizona when I was visiting an Indian reservation. There were present a white man and his family, a Hopi couple, a Navajo couple, and myself. We had been trying to get the Indians to sing Indian songs and, as a part of the warming up process, I hummed this tune.'Sing that again,' one of the Indians said. I hummed it again. 'Did you ever know anything like that?' I finally asked. Another Indian spoke up, 'Sure! That's a Shoshone night chant. I've heard it many times.'"

          "Cumberland Gap, a popular fiddle tune, celebrates a pass through the Appalachian Mountains that still looms large in the culture of Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky.  Cumberland Gap was discovered in 1750 by Dr. Thomas Walker.  In 1775 Daniel Boone blazed the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap, into Kentucky.  For fifty years, especially during the Revolution, it was the main highway west. But it was not until 1790 that the road was broad enough for wagon and team. By 1820 the road extended to the Ohio River. During the Civil War the pass was the site of several battles, some of which are commemorated by additional verses which appear in some versions of the song. Liner notes by Moses Asch from Folkways FP 5003, Frontier Ballads and by Patrick Warfield from Folkways SFW 40187, A Treasury of Civil War Songs."

The singing begins as the two circles walk in opposite directions.  On the last syllable of the song, “o,” the “gates” raise their arms, but all continue walking.  The “farmers” must find their way to the middle of the smaller circle and retrieve the rubber chicken."

The one in the center chooses one to dance with him, and they swing right and left in the circle. All the players then swing each other right or left as they meet. The tempo is usually increased as the song progresses. The person first in the ring yields his place to the one chosen and the game continues.The use of such words as 'Ford' and 'chewing-gum' illustrates the fact that play-party songs are still in the process of development."

          "HS - The Erie Canal, authorized in 1817 and completed in 1825, was of immense significance in the development of the United States.  Connecting Lake Erie (Buffalo) and the Hudson River (Albany), the 363-mile waterway linked the east to the west.  It was by far the most spectacular transportation development of hte period.  The cheap, all-water route carried agricultural produce from the west to the east and manufactured goods from the east to the west.  Cities sprang up along the route.  With transportation no longer a problem, pioneers by tens of thousands settled vacant western lands.  The canal teemed with boats and barges.  Songs of the mule skinners who drove the mules along the tow paths as they hauled the flat-bottom carriers echoed across the country day and night.  Low bridges were built across the canal at frequent intervals.  The skinners shouted a warning to the passengers on the boards when approaching a bridge.  The call “low bridge ahead” was a signal for everyone on board to drop flat on the deck until the bridge was cleared.  This song made its debut as a minstrel song, but it made its home in the folk tradition."

          "HS - This very old humor song was preserved in the isolation of the southern mountains.  The words varied with the immediate area in which is was sung.  It most often was sung in unison and served as a rollicking fiddle tune for the rural dances.  Appalachia was a world apart, nestled in the southern mountains.  During the seventeenth century, immigrants from the British Isles settled there.  They kept to themselves partly by choice, partly because of the inaccessibility of the rugged terrain, and partly because transportation was primitive.  Songs were handed down orally through the generations.  Many that died out a century or more ago in the British Isles still are sung regularly in the mountain areas of the South. It has been said that nearly every folk song sung in the British Isles still can be found in these mountain regions.  This may very well be true.  Music there is a vital, living thing. Most homes have at least one musical instrument and everybody sings--from the youngest to the oldest inhabitant."

          "HS - This song crossed the country with prospectors heading for western gold, and “Sweet Betsy” came to represent every girl who might have made the perilous trip.  This song is typical of the exaggerated humor and satire sometimes found in songs of the frontier.  Carl Sandburg wrote of Sweet Betsy from Pike, “It has the stuff of a realistic novel.  It is droll and don’t-care, bleary and leering, as slippery and lackadaisical as some of the come characters of Shakespeare.”  The melody was brought to this country under the name Villikins and his Dinah, a copy of which is in the British Museum in a very old manuscript."

          "HS - The beliefs expressed in Swing Low, Sweet Chariot are typical of those found in the many spirituals that originated in America.  Home represents the promised land, and the River Jordan is symbolic of an obstacle that has to be overcome or crossed to get there.  The words “coming for to carry me home” may be sung by the entire group and the alternating phrases by a soloist for varied effect.  There is an ancient legend of a wise and good king in Africa who was taken to heaven in a golden chariot before the eyes of his amazed people.  This song may have come from Africa to southern plantations."

          "HS - Weevily Wheat originally was a jester’s song which referred to Charles II of England and was sung to an old English country dance tune.  In the United States it became a play party game song and square dance tune.  The weevils about which it tells are members of the beetle family with heads that end in projecting snouts.  The grubs, or larvae, hatch from eggs and are highly destructive to many crops.  They are difficult to control with sprays and are destroyed by burning infected plants, grain, and fruit, and by digging up the ground in which they spend the winter."

The joke backfired.  The song delighted the colonists, as it has Americans ever since, and they sang it through the war and on to victory.  The melody is much older.  It was a harvesting song in Holland in the 1500s (and perhaps earlier) and was known in England in the 1600s.  A version appeared in print about 1778 in a Glasgow publication, Aird’s Selection of Scottish, English, Irish, and Foreign Airs.  The first American publication to include it seems to have been Benjamin Carr’s Federal Overture in 1795."
