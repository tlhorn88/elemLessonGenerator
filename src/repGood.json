        "HNU: his halyard song is the only known representative of a sizeable group of Anglicized Polynesian work-songs popular at one time among seamen in the various Pacific Islands trades.  Dana, in his Two Years Before the Mast, refers to such songs and the singing of them by Mahana, an Hawaiian shantyman in the hide carriers of the Pacific Slope of America in the 1830s.  The one given here appears to have Samoan connections.  However, it was not limited to ships in the Pacific Island trades, this one being very popular in most American sailing ships of the mid-nineteenth century. John Kanaka is one of the few representatives of the three-line solo and three-line refrain shanties. The 'oh' in the third solo, when sung by a good shantyman, was always rendered with a hitch (a sort of wild yelp)."

        "HNU - The ancient British game 'Three Dukes A-Riding' is a courtship play in which an increasing number of 'dukes' come to choose their brides from a line of young maidens, in what may be a reflection of marriage customs between clans in old Britain. Both British and American writers describe it as a line play, with the parallel lines of maidens and dukes advancing and retreating, looking 'contemptuously and criticizingly' at each other as they sing 'You are too black and blowsy' and 'We are quite as good as you, sirs' before they finally join forces. The Sea Islanders don't bother with 'contemptuous and criticizing looks'; they simply turn their backs and 'switch' their hips in their opponents' faces. (The hip switching motion is achieved by standing with the legs together and bending one knee forward while the other goes back into a locked position; alternate knees for the other side.)Further, the plot of Mrs. Jones's version no longer concerns coquetry and courtship but the choosing of 'soldiers' ;the phrase 'You are too black and dirty' is scarcely part of the language of love.  In play, however, this is an uproariously good-humored game and one of the favorites of both adults and children.  Both sides get to dramatize hostility in a very down-to-earth fashion; and even though children are used to having rude remarks made about their personal appearance, the ones I have seen playing this game get absolutely enormous satisfaction out of being able to answer back, for once, 'I am just as clean as you are!'"

        "When this game was played by the children of Dr. and Mrs. Frank Allen Hubbard of Taunton, Massachusetts, both boys and girls joined in the game. It was believed in the Middle Ages that the soul separated from the body and, before reaching its final destination, was forced to cross a bridge; succeeding. it was assured of eternal peace. No edifice, in those early times, was more important than a bridge; hence sanctity was attributed to the builders. It was supposed that the Devil had a certain antipathy toward bridges because of repeated and successful destruction of them. In legends he is finally bought off with offers of all descriptions. It is known that great erections entailed human sacrifice;but there was no particular code of ethics as to how the sacrifice should be secured. The unwary traveler peacefully going about his own affairs was quite likely to be seized and beheaded for these rites. That would appease a horrid deity. Of the building of the Tower of London in the twelfth century, Fitzstephen writes that the mortar was mixed with the blood of wild beasts. And it is said the secret of the ancient Irish masons' fine craft was this very mixture of blood and sand. It is well known that men's heads often decorated the bridges and gates of a city, and it is reasonably conjectured that there was other blood in the masonry than that of beasts.A combination of both explanations makes a very satisfactory background to the singing game, 'London Bridge.' The seizure of the prisoner is thus explained as foundation rites, and the tug of war that ends the game, the struggle for the possession of the soul."

The captured players alternately form lines behind their respective captains.  The verses are repeated until all of the players are selected."

It stands on both sides of the Thames River which is both tidal and navigable and which narrows to 325 yards at the site of the London Bridge.  One of the many fine bridges that now span the Thames, London Bridge  first was built by the Romans.  It was hauled down by Vikings in the eleventh century but was later rebuilt.  It was the only bridge across the river until 1750.  Another bridge was built in 1831 of Aberdeen granite.  This is the bridge that was dismantled, shipped to Arizona, and reconstructed at Lake Havasu City."

'As I have written these tunes, ' says Mr. Ware, 'two measures are to be sung to each stroke, the first measure being accented by the beginning of the stroke, the second by the rattle of the oars in the rowlocks.  On the passenger boat at the [Beaufort] ferry, they rowed from sixteen to thirty strokes a minute; twenty-four was the average.  'Michael row' was used when the load was heavy or the tide was against us.'  -- Allen et al, Slave Songs of the United States"

        "HS - According to legend, this song had a verse for every mile of trail from Texas to Kansas, not all of them printable.  Armed cowboys brought the first herd of 2,400 longhorn cattle from San Antonio to the newly opened yards of J.G. McCoy in Abilene in 1867.  The route followed a trail blazed by Jesse Chisholm, a trader and government interpreter who was half Cherokee Indian.  Between 1868 and 1871, when railroads were extended further west, more than 1 ½ million cattle were herded over the trail.  On the long cattle drives cowboys sang to pass the time and to amuse themselves.  During the night watches they sang to quiet the herd, locate other riders, and keep themselves awake.  The refrain may have been borrowed from the Indians."

When the singing starts, the players hold hands and march to their right. At the chorus, the boys turn back and begin weaving through the line of girls, swinging the first by the left hand, the second by the right, and so on until they reach their partners. Then they promenade through a verse and chorus and form the ring again. For variety's sake the boys change partners by dropping back to the girl behind them and then swing their ladies twice the second time around.

        "Joe Clark was a Virginian (and a preacher's son, so the song says), who fought in the War of 1812. In recognition of his services, the state gave him a claim in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Clark settled there in 1815 and established the family name by siring twenty-four children. His influence over his family and the surrounding country soon made him the man to be reckoned with. From an imposing figure of a man, dominating a large hunting ground, he grew to be a legendary character with a song to continue his fame. Old Joe Clark, for all his wealth and influence and dubious fame, evidently gained his notoriety as a result of a mean disposition rather than any enduring contributions to his society."

Dancers stepped to the rhythm of the nonsense jingles they improvised, and scores of verses were made up as the dance progressed.  Old Joe Clark often was played on the harmonica and guitar as well as the fiddle.  Its date of origin is unknown, but it was part of the wave of frontier tomfoolery which washed over the country following the War of 1812."

Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie struck a responsive chord in lonely cowboys, and the words were sung to a variety of tunes.

And so they was walking up a hill, as they always walked together in the forest, and so the possum--you know, the possum’s got a poket underneath his stomach--and in that pocket the possum had a forty-dollar bill.  (You know there isn’t any such thing as a forty-dollar bill.)",
        "So the rabbit, he noticed it, and the rabbit, he didn’t know how to get that money.  He knes he couldn’t take it; he couldn’t robber.  So they went on up there and the rabbit looked at the possum, say, “Possum, let’s play seven-up.”  The possum say, “All right.”  They started playing seven-up.  They played and played and the rabbit knew he could beat him because he’s cunning.  He won all Brother Possum’s money.",
        "Brother Possum looked at him mean and bad, you know, and kind of grinned, and the rabbit knew good and well he better not bother that money because the possum’s going to known him down.  And so that rabbit just got him a quick lick, and he knock Brother Possum and Brother Possum fell.  (You know the possum will fall stiff every time you hit him.)  And the rabbit grabbed that money and over the hill with it and he said, “Fare you well!”  So that’s why we sing..."

        "HNU - It has often alleged that this rhyme refers to the Black Plague, but there is no basis for this belief.

Oral tradition in England and Ireland often includes a second verse providing for the players to get up again."

        "Stories of its origin are conflicting.  For many years it has been believed to have originated at the time of the Black Plague in London (1665)--that “ring” and “rosie” referred to the rash that came with the dread disease, that the “pocket full of posie” was a bag of herbs worn around the nexk to ward off the sickness, and that “all fall down” simply depicted what happened to a large part of the population at the time.",
        "Some authorities cast doubt on this history; they trace the meaning of “rosie” to the myth that gifted children had the power to “laugh roses” and interpret “all fall down” to merely mean “curtsy.”  However, the authors are inclined to believe that the former is more in keeping with the evolution of children’s singing games of similar antiquity."
