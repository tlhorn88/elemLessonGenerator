        "HS - In early America, many different sets of words telling diverse stories and legends were sung to favorite or familiar tunes.  Old Texas and Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie were sung to the same tune and shared a common air of deep sadness.  Such laments were not uncommon on the plains.  Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie struck a responsive chord in lonely cowboys, and the words were sung to a variety of tunes.  Many parodies have been based on this song, and the “lone prair-ee” has become a stereotype of the early west."

        "Stories of its origin are conflicting.  For many years it has been believed to have originated at the time of the Black Plague in London (1665)--that “ring” and “rosie” referred to the rash that came with the dread disease, that the “pocket full of posie” was a bag of herbs worn around the nexk to ward off the sickness, and that “all fall down” simply depicted what happened to a large part of the population at the time.",
        "Some authorities cast doubt on this history; they trace the meaning of “rosie” to the myth that gifted children had the power to “laugh roses” and interpret “all fall down” to merely mean “curtsy.”  However, the authors are inclined to believe that the former is more in keeping with the evolution of children’s singing games of similar antiquity."
