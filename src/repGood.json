The child walks away, and returns in a few moments and asks whether the shoe is ready. The Cobbler says, 'Not quite; call again in an hour's time,' or makes any other excuse which occurs to him.

I remember singing it over and over as I walked back some three miles from his home out in the country. The kinship of all folk music was once made clear to me out in Arizona when I was visiting an Indian reservation. There were present a white man and his family, a Hopi couple, a Navajo couple, and myself. We had been trying to get the Indians to sing Indian songs and, as a part of the warming up process, I hummed this tune.'Sing that again,' one of the Indians said. I hummed it again. 'Did you ever know anything like that?' I finally asked. Another Indian spoke up, 'Sure! That's a Shoshone night chant. I've heard it many times.'"

        "Cumberland Gap, a popular fiddle tune, celebrates a pass through the Appalachian Mountains that still looms large in the culture of Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky.  Cumberland Gap was discovered in 1750 by Dr. Thomas Walker.  In 1775 Daniel Boone blazed the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap, into Kentucky.  For fifty years, especially during the Revolution, it was the main highway west. But it was not until 1790 that the road was broad enough for wagon and team. By 1820 the road extended to the Ohio River. During the Civil War the pass was the site of several battles, some of which are commemorated by additional verses which appear in some versions of the song. Liner notes by Moses Asch from Folkways FP 5003, Frontier Ballads and by Patrick Warfield from Folkways SFW 40187, A Treasury of Civil War Songs."

The singing begins as the two circles walk in opposite directions.  On the last syllable of the song, “o,” the “gates” raise their arms, but all continue walking.

The tempo is usually increased as the song progresses. The person first in the ring yields his place to the one chosen and the game continues.The use of such words as 'Ford' and 'chewing-gum' illustrates the fact that play-party songs are still in the process of development."

        "HS - The Erie Canal, authorized in 1817 and completed in 1825, was of immense significance in the development of the United States.  Connecting Lake Erie (Buffalo) and the Hudson River (Albany), the 363-mile waterway linked the east to the west.  It was by far the most spectacular transportation development of hte period.  The cheap, all-water route carried agricultural produce from the west to the east and manufactured goods from the east to the west.  Cities sprang up along the route.  With transportation no longer a problem, pioneers by tens of thousands settled vacant western lands.  The canal teemed with boats and barges.  Songs of the mule skinners who drove the mules along the tow paths as they hauled the flat-bottom carriers echoed across the country day and night.  Low bridges were built across the canal at frequent intervals.  The skinners shouted a warning to the passengers on the boards when approaching a bridge.  The call “low bridge ahead” was a signal for everyone on board to drop flat on the deck until the bridge was cleared.  This song made its debut as a minstrel song, but it made its home in the folk tradition."

Dana, in his Two Years Before the Mast, refers to such songs and the singing of them by Mahana, an Hawaiian shantyman in the hide carriers of the Pacific Slope of America in the 1830s.  The one given here appears to have Samoan connections.  However, it was not limited to ships in the Pacific Island trades, this one being very popular in most American sailing ships of the mid-nineteenth century. John Kanaka is one of the few representatives of the three-line solo and three-line refrain shanties. The 'oh' in the third solo, when sung by a good shantyman, was always rendered with a hitch (a sort of wild yelp)."

        "HNU - The ancient British game 'Three Dukes A-Riding' is a courtship play in which an increasing number of 'dukes' come to choose their brides from a line of young maidens, in what may be a reflection of marriage customs between clans in old Britain. Both British and American writers describe it as a line play, with the parallel lines of maidens and dukes advancing and retreating, looking 'contemptuously and criticizingly' at each other as they sing 'You are too black and blowsy' and 'We are quite as good as you, sirs' before they finally join forces. The Sea Islanders don't bother with 'contemptuous and criticizing looks'; they simply turn their backs and 'switch' their hips in their opponents' faces. (The hip switching motion is achieved by standing with the legs together and bending one knee forward while the other goes back into a locked position; alternate knees for the other side.)Further, the plot of Mrs. Jones's version no longer concerns coquetry and courtship but the choosing of 'soldiers' ;the phrase 'You are too black and dirty' is scarcely part of the language of love.  In play, however, this is an uproariously good-humored game and one of the favorites of both adults and children.  Both sides get to dramatize hostility in a very down-to-earth fashion; and even though children are used to having rude remarks made about their personal appearance, the ones I have seen playing this game get absolutely enormous satisfaction out of being able to answer back, for once, 'I am just as clean as you are!'"

On one occasion she described this as an 'after-slavery play': 'He's so glad-he's free and got his own bread so he fly away over yonder He's so glad he got freedom food!' --Bessie Jones and Bess Lomax Hawes, Step it Down."

The object of the game is for the lone man in the middle of the ring to steal a partner from one of the men in the dancing circle. Then the robbed man must take the center, and it now becomes his turn to find a mate. So the game goes on, with a constant shifting of partners, while each solo dancer vies with his predecessors in a marvelous abandonment of dance-improvisation.

        "When this game was played by the children of Dr. and Mrs. Frank Allen Hubbard of Taunton, Massachusetts, both boys and girls joined in the game. It was believed in the Middle Ages that the soul separated from the body and, before reaching its final destination, was forced to cross a bridge; succeeding. it was assured of eternal peace. No edifice, in those early times, was more important than a bridge; hence sanctity was attributed to the builders. It was supposed that the Devil had a certain antipathy toward bridges because of repeated and successful destruction of them. In legends he is finally bought off with offers of all descriptions. It is known that great erections entailed human sacrifice;but there was no particular code of ethics as to how the sacrifice should be secured. The unwary traveler peacefully going about his own affairs was quite likely to be seized and beheaded for these rites. That would appease a horrid deity. Of the building of the Tower of London in the twelfth century, Fitzstephen writes that the mortar was mixed with the blood of wild beasts. And it is said the secret of the ancient Irish masons' fine craft was this very mixture of blood and sand. It is well known that men's heads often decorated the bridges and gates of a city, and it is reasonably conjectured that there was other blood in the masonry than that of beasts.A combination of both explanations makes a very satisfactory background to the singing game, 'London Bridge.' The seizure of the prisoner is thus explained as foundation rites, and the tug of war that ends the game, the struggle for the possession of the soul."

As the song is sung, the other players walk single file in a circle passing under the arch.  On the final word of each verse the captains drop their arms and capture a player.  The captured players alternately form lines behind their respective captains.  The verses are repeated until all of the players are selected."

It stands on both sides of the Thames River which is both tidal and navigable and which narrows to 325 yards at the site of the London Bridge.  One of the many fine bridges that now span the Thames, London Bridge  first was built by the Romans.  It was hauled down by Vikings in the eleventh century but was later rebuilt.  It was the only bridge across the river until 1750.  Another bridge was built in 1831 of Aberdeen granite.  This is the bridge that was dismantled, shipped to Arizona, and reconstructed at Lake Havasu City."

'As I have written these tunes, ' says Mr. Ware, 'two measures are to be sung to each stroke, the first measure being accented by the beginning of the stroke, the second by the rattle of the oars in the rowlocks.  On the passenger boat at the [Beaufort] ferry, they rowed from sixteen to thirty strokes a minute; twenty-four was the average.  'Michael row' was used when the load was heavy or the tide was against us.'  -- Allen et al, Slave Songs of the United States"

        "HS - According to legend, this song had a verse for every mile of trail from Texas to Kansas, not all of them printable.  Armed cowboys brought the first herd of 2,400 longhorn cattle from San Antonio to the newly opened yards of J.G. McCoy in Abilene in 1867.  The route followed a trail blazed by Jesse Chisholm, a trader and government interpreter who was half Cherokee Indian.  Between 1868 and 1871, when railroads were extended further west, more than 1 ½ million cattle were herded over the trail.  On the long cattle drives cowboys sang to pass the time and to amuse themselves.  During the night watches they sang to quiet the herd, locate other riders, and keep themselves awake.  The refrain may have been borrowed from the Indians."

When the singing starts, the players hold hands and march to their right. At the chorus, the boys turn back and begin weaving through the line of girls, swinging the first by the left hand, the second by the right, and so on until they reach their partners. Then they promenade through a verse and chorus and form the ring again. For variety's sake the boys change partners by dropping back to the girl behind them and then swing their ladies twice the second time around.

        "Joe Clark was a Virginian (and a preacher's son, so the song says), who fought in the War of 1812. In recognition of his services, the state gave him a claim in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Clark settled there in 1815 and established the family name by siring twenty-four children. His influence over his family and the surrounding country soon made him the man to be reckoned with. From an imposing figure of a man, dominating a large hunting ground, he grew to be a legendary character with a song to continue his fame. Old Joe Clark, for all his wealth and influence and dubious fame, evidently gained his notoriety as a result of a mean disposition rather than any enduring contributions to his society."

Dancers stepped to the rhythm of the nonsense jingles they improvised, and scores of verses were made up as the dance progressed.  Old Joe Clark often was played on the harmonica and guitar as well as the fiddle.  Its date of origin is unknown, but it was part of the wave of frontier tomfoolery which washed over the country following the War of 1812."

Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie struck a responsive chord in lonely cowboys, and the words were sung to a variety of tunes.  Many parodies have been based on this song, and the “lone prair-ee” has become a stereotype of the early west."

        "Stories of its origin are conflicting.  For many years it has been believed to have originated at the time of the Black Plague in London (1665)--that “ring” and “rosie” referred to the rash that came with the dread disease, that the “pocket full of posie” was a bag of herbs worn around the nexk to ward off the sickness, and that “all fall down” simply depicted what happened to a large part of the population at the time.",
        "Some authorities cast doubt on this history; they trace the meaning of “rosie” to the myth that gifted children had the power to “laugh roses” and interpret “all fall down” to merely mean “curtsy.”  However, the authors are inclined to believe that the former is more in keeping with the evolution of children’s singing games of similar antiquity."

The person whose partner is stolen follows immediately, skipping round the ring and stealing another partner.

A single person in the center would “steal” a partner, the odd dancer would proceed to the center, and the dance would continue.

        "HS - This very old humor song was preserved in the isolation of the southern mountains.  The words varied with the immediate area in which is was sung.  It most often was sung in unison and served as a rollicking fiddle tune for the rural dances.  Appalachia was a world apart, nestled in the southern mountains.  During the seventeenth century, immigrants from the British Isles settled there.  They kept to themselves partly by choice, partly because of the inaccessibility of the rugged terrain, and partly because transportation was primitive.  Songs were handed down orally through the generations.  Many that died out a century or more ago in the British Isles still are sung regularly in the mountain areas of the South. It has been said that nearly every folk song sung in the British Isles still can be found in these mountain regions.  This may very well be true.  Music there is a vital, living thing. Most homes have at least one musical instrument and everybody sings--from the youngest to the oldest inhabitant."

It is droll and don’t-care, bleary and leering, as slippery and lackadaisical as some of the come characters of Shakespeare.”  The melody was brought to this country under the name Villikins and his Dinah, a copy of which is in the British Museum in a very old manuscript."

        "HS - Weevily Wheat originally was a jester’s song which referred to Charles II of England and was sung to an old English country dance tune.  In the United States it became a play party game song and square dance tune.  The weevils about which it tells are members of the beetle family with heads that end in projecting snouts.  The grubs, or larvae, hatch from eggs and are highly destructive to many crops.  They are difficult to control with sprays and are destroyed by burning infected plants, grain, and fruit, and by digging up the ground in which they spend the winter."

        "HS - A parody meant to mock the Continental army, these lyrics were written for and presented to the colonists in 1775 by a British army surgeon Dr. Richard Schuckburgh, who passed it off as popular English martial music.  The joke backfired.  The song delighted the colonists, as it has Americans ever since, and they sang it through the war and on to victory.  The melody is much older.  It was a harvesting song in Holland in the 1500s (and perhaps earlier) and was known in England in the 1600s.  A version appeared in print about 1778 in a Glasgow publication, Aird’s Selection of Scottish, English, Irish, and Foreign Airs.  The first American publication to include it seems to have been Benjamin Carr’s Federal Overture in 1795."
